# Procedural Saver/Loader
SaverLoader (saver_loader.gd) can save procedural scene trees of arbitrary structure and rebuild them on load. It persists data from procedural and non-procedural objects â€“ but only what you tell it to persist! Saves and loads are very fast because we don't save whole objects.

This system is used in [I, Voyager](https://ivoyager.dev) to save/load a procedurally built Solar System with >100 planets & moons and up to 600,000+ asteroids. Our save/load times with an ssd drive are on the order of ~1 second!
